# srm-class-rooms-lab-management
                            SRM class room and lab management system is used to maintain all the class and labs details. It helps the academic planning group in assigning rooms and labs for the regular schedule. It will display the details of the class or lab going in that particular room based on the allotment. We use the C++ program for completion of the project.This particular program is used to show the vacant room numbers with their seating capacity for booking and if any faculty needs a room at particular time can book a room based on the requirement of the class. This project makes easy to the lab assistants and faculty to add their note on the power issues infrastructural issues, or equipment issues for resolution.
